Which of the given options provides the increasing order of complexity of functions f1, f2, f3 and f4 and why ? (Write Description) :





f1(n) = 2^n



f2(n) = n^(3/2)



f3(n) = nLogn



f4(n) = n^(Logn)



Answers:-



 f3, f2, f4, f1
 f3, f2, f1, f4
 f2, f3, f1, f4
 f2, f3, f4, f1

 Your Answer
1. f3,f2,f4,f1

Naming the equations as 1,2,3,4 

Consider any 2 equations and make it in equal format by taking log and apply some value for n and check which is greater and continue the procedure
